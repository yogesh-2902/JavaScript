Notes on Event Bubbling and Event Capture(This topic is very important in terms of interview for Front end Developer)

Note: To implement event bubble we have to use addEventListener

-> Event Bubbling is a default behaviour (Refer to youtube for some reference)
-> Event capture is vice versa of event bubblinh

->Event Delegation - Its a way of utilizing Event Bubbling and prevent ourselves from attaching eventListeners to all child items 

syntax for bubbling -> for addEventListener(event-type, callback function , useCapture = true);

syntax for eventCapture -> for addEventListener(event-type, callback function , useCapture = false);

StopWatch Tasks
1. Click on start event 
2. update total seconds using SetInterval with duration of 1000ms or 1s
3. Update text for sec and if limit is reached updated mm and similary for hh using total second variable
        hours = totalSeconds / 3600;
        minutes = totalSeconds / 60;
        second = totalSeconds;

        Example : totalSeconds = 4520 seconds to hh:mm:ss
            hours = 4520/3600 => 1.319 => 1
            minutes = (4520/60) % 60 => 15
            second = 4520 % 60 => 20


10 milliseconds = 1 centisecond
10 centiseconds = 1 deciseconds
10 deciseconds = 1 second
10 seconds = 1 decasecond
10 decaseconds = 1 hectosecond
10 hectosecond = 1kilosecond
