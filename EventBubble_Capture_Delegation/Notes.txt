Notes on Event Bubbling and Event Capture(This topic is very important in terms of interview for Front end Developer)

-> Event Bubbling is a default behaviour (Refer to youtube for some reference)

->Event Delegation - Its a way of utilizing Event Bubbling and prevent ourselves from attaching eventListeners to all child items 


StopWatch Tasks
1. Click on start event 
2. update total seconds using SetInterval with duration of 1000ms or 1s
3. Update text for sec and if limit is reached updated mm and similary for hh using total second variable
        hours = totalSeconds / 3600;
        minutes = totalSeconds / 60;
        second = totalSeconds;

        Example : totalSeconds = 4520 seconds to hh:mm:ss
            hours = 4520/3600 => 1.319 => 1
            minutes = (4520/60) % 60 => 15
            second = 4520 % 60 => 20
