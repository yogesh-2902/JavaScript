//let vs const
/*const -> re-assign in not possible in const variable
let -> re-assign is possible in let variable

Scope
let and const -> both of them are block scoped

Assign value:
When we create a let value we can assign the value afterwards, but cannot be re-declared, but in const we have declare the value there itself.

Difference between "==" and '===' ?
Both are the same but in '==' implicit type coercion takes place meaning the typeof is automatcially changed by program.
== -> value

=== -> type and value
