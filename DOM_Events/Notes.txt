//Mouse Events

Three ways of wroking with events in JavaScript
1.Inline attribute
2.object property
//The main difference between the 2 and 1 is we cannot add more than 2 event handler functions, if we add it will be overridden
3.addEventListener()
//Can attach mutltiple event handler functions
//We can control capturing/bubbling
