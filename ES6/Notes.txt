ES6 Notes

Best Reference -> http://es6-features.org/#ExpressionBodies

Creator -> Brendan Eich
Ecma(Europe Computer Manufacture Association) Script -> ES6 in 2015 
After ES6 they started with yearly release
Currently -> ES13

New Features
1. Introduction of 'let' and 'const'
2. Block Scope
3. Arrow Functions
4. Default parameters for functions(even when no argument is provided to function when executed.)
5. Rest Operator which is used to provide as arguments inside a function
6. Spread Operator
7. for-in and for-of loops
7. Destructuring of arrays and objects


//ways to iterate over key of objects and get values of objects
1. Object.keys() -> returns all the properties of the objects as an array
2. Object.entries() => returns all the keys value pairs in the object as an array
3. for-in loop to iterate over keys of object.



Note: 'in' is a keyword used which returns boolean value
Ex: const obj = {a:1, b:2};

console.log(a in obj); //true


//Guess Output and explain

const obj1 = {a:1, b:2};
const obj2 = {...obj1, d:4};b

for(const key in obj2){
    console.log(obj2[key]); //This means we need obj2 values based on key and we used this method when we have for-of or for-in loop which is used instead of console.log(obj2.key) which returns undefined
}

Ans: 1,2,4

//Guess Output and explain (TRICK QUESTION)

const arr = [{a:1},{b:2},{c:3}];
const item = [...arr][2];

console.log(item);

for (const item of arr) {
    console.log(item['a']);
}

Ans: {c:3}
     1 undefined undefined


//Guess Output and explain (TRICK QUESTION)
let a;
const b = 2;
const c = 3;
console.log({a,b,c});

A:{a:undefined , b : 2, c:3} Property shorthand concept 


//Guess Output and explain (TRICK QUESTION)
const {c} = {a:1,b:2,c:3};
console.log(c**2);

A: 9 //Concept of Object Destructuring


//Guess Output and explain

const arr = ["a","b","c"];
const obj = {a:1, b:2,c:3};

const [a0,a1,a2] = arr;
const {a,b,c} = obj;

console.log(a0.repeat(a));
console.log(a1.repeat(b));
console.log(a2.repeat(c));

A: a bb ccc
